# Bartleby, The Mapper

A map generated from Melville's "Bartleby the Scriviner" For 19th Century NY: Urban Atlas @ NYU

### Origin

Bartleby, in Melville's tale, is a "scriviner", one who copies and edits written scripts for legal purposes.
Although we are not scriviners in the conventional sense, we have become scriviners who take from old material and
repurpose for modern uses.

### Description

In this particular project, we tried to map some of the descriptions of the law office that Bartleby worked in.

We took mentions of particular words that describe furniture or characteristics of the room, and paired the number of occurrences of those words to an image representation of that word.
